First of all, what is Left 4 Gmod? Left 4 Gmod is a mod that allows you to play Garry's Mod in the Left 4 Dead Engine! You may ask us that what is the point of all of this, we can already get content in the original Garry's Mod! There are also other things that the L4D engine brings that the Orangebox Engine which Garry's Mod runs on that can't do. Here are some of those things:
-Many more NPC Wars without Lag!
-HORDES! HORDES! HORDES!
-Friendly Bots to fight alongside with!
-Improved Physics Engine!
-Improved Lighting Effects!
-Left 4 Dead Director!
